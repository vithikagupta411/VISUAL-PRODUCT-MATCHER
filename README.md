# Visual Product Matcher (Skeleton — Step 1)

This repository contains the **starter structure** only. We'll fill code step-by-step.

## Structure
- `app.py` — Flask app (to be implemented later)
- `prepare_data.py` — Script to build `products.db` with embeddings (later)
- `products.csv` — Add at least 50 rows: `name,category,image_url`
- `templates/` — HTML templates
- `static/` — CSS/JS/assets; `static/uploads/` will store uploaded images

## Next
We'll add data, embeddings, routes, and UI in the following steps.
